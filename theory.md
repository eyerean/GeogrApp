Geography Theory
================

##### Lesson 1 - Intro

Geography (from Greek γεωγραφία, geographia, lit. "earth description") is a field of science dedicated to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of the Earth. A literal translation would be "to describe or write about the Earth".

In these lessons we will focus on the basics of Geography. The aspects covered will be information about countries, capitals of each country, location of islands and countries on the continents, location of mountains and rivers on countries and continents.

After taking the lessons, you can examine what you have learned by taking the tests provided in this app.



##### Lesson 2 - Continents

A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. They are generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, with up to seven regions commonly regarded as continents. These are (from largest in size to smallest):

Asia
Africa
North America
South America
Antarctika
Europe
Australia

<image me tis 7 continents>

Another popular theory unites North America and South America into one continent, whereas another theory claims that Asia and Europe consist one continent, named "Eurasia".

In our tests and lessons, we will accept the first theory of the 7 continents.

In geology, continents are described by means of tectonic plates. Plate tectonics is the process and study of the movement, collision and division of continents.

On the table below we list information about the population of each continent:

Continent | Total Population | Percent of total population | Most populous city
Asia | 4,164,252,000 | 60% | Shanghai, China
Africa | 1,022,234,000 | 15% | Lagos, Nigeria
North America | 542,056,000 | 8% | Mexico City, Mexico
South America | 392,555,000 | 6% | Sao Paulo, Brazil
Antarctika | 4,490 | 0% | -
Europe | 738,199,000 | 11% | Moscow, Russia
Australia | 29,127,000 | 0.4% | Sydney, Australia

The total land area of all continents is 148,647,000 square kilometres, or 29.1% of earth's surface (510,065,600 km2).

A rough estimate of the total population of all the continents is 7,000,000,000.

##### Lesson 4 - Mountains

A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. 
Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. 
Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.

High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystem of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. 
Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.

The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,849.868 m above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m.


There are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. 
The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.

The 10 highest mountains of the world are:
	ul#mountains
		li: <b>Mount Everest</b>
			Mount Everest or Qomolangma is the Earth’s highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres above sea level. It is located in the Mahalangur section of the Himalayas. The international border between China and Nepal runs across the precise summit point.
		li: <b>Aconcagua</b>
			Aconcagua is the highest mountain in the Americas at 6,960.8 m. It is located in the Andes mountain range, in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, and lies 112 kilometres west by north of its capital, the city of Mendoza.
		li: <b>Mount McKinley</b>
			Mount McKinley, or Denali (Koyukon Athabaskan for “The High One”), in Alaska, is the highest mountain peak in the United States and in North America, with a summit elevation of (6,194 m) above sea level.
		li: <b>Mount Kilimanjaro</b>
			Kilimanjaro, with its three volcanic cones, Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira, is a dormant volcanic mountain in Kilimanjaro National Park, Tanzania. It is the highest mountain in Africa at 5,895 metres above sea level.
		li: <b>Pico Cristóbal Colón</b>
			Pico Cristóbal Colón is the highest mountain in Colombia, with an estimated height of 5,700 metres.

			Mount Logan is the highest mountain in Canada and the second-highest peak in North America, after Mount McKinley (Denali).
		li: Pico de Orizaba
			The Pico de Orizaba, or Citlaltépetl, is a stratovolcano, the highest mountain in Mexico and the third highest in North America. It rises 5,636 metres above sea level in the eastern end of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, on the border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla.

##### Lesson 5 - Rivers


A river is a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea, or another river. 
In a rare cases a river could flow into the ground and dry up completely at the end of its course, without reaching another body of water.

Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle. Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g. from glaciers). 
Potamology is the scientific study of rivers while limnology is the study of inland waters in general.

The 10 longest rivers in the world are:
	ul#rivers
		li: <b>Nile</b>
			The Nile is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa, generally regarded as the longest river in the world. It is 6,650 km long and runs through the ten countries of Sudan, South Sudan, Burundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Egypt.
		li: <b>Amazon River</b>
			The Amazon River in South America is the second longest river in the world and by far the largest by water flow with an average discharge greater than the next seven largest rivers combined.
		li: <b>Yangtze River</b>
			The Yangtze River, or Chang Jiang is the longest river in Asia, and the third longest in the world. It flows for 6,418 kilometres from the glaciers on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in Qinghai eastward across southwest, central and eastern China before emptying into the East China Sea at Shanghai.
		li: <b>Mississippi River</b>
			The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest river system in North America. Flowing entirely in the United States (though its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for 4,070 km to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi’s watershed drains all or parts of 31 US states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains.
		li: <b>Yenisei River</b>
			Yenisei, also written as Yenisey, is the largest river system flowing to the Arctic Ocean. Rising in Mongolia, it follows a northerly course to the Yenisei Gulf in the Kara Sea, draining a large part of central Siberia, the longest stream following the Yenisei-Angara-Selenga-Ider river system.
		li: <b>Yellow River</b>
			The Yellow River or Huang He, formerly spelled Hwang Ho, is the second-longest river in China after the Yangtze and the sixth-longest in the world at the estimated length of 5,464 kilometers.
		li: <b>Ob River</b>
			The Ob River, also Obi, is a major river in western Siberia, Russia and is the world’s seventh longest river. It is the westernmost of the three great Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the Yenisei River and the Lena River).
		li: <b>Paraná River</b>
			The Paraná River is a river in south Central South America, running through Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina for some 4,880 kilometres. It is second in length only to the Amazon River among South American rivers.
		li: <b>Congo River</b>
			The Congo River (in the past also known as the Zaire River) is a river in Africa, and is the deepest river in the world, with measured depths in excess of 220 m. It is the third largest river in the world by volume of water discharged.
		li: <b>Amur River</b>
			The Amur, or Heilong Jiang, is the world’s tenth longest river, forming the border between the Russian Far East and Northeastern China (Inner Manchuria).
